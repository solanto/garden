# hello, there.

I'm Andrew. I grow some of my thoughts here, in what's best described as a [digital garden](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners#theory-philosophy-and-navel-gazing). Hit [into the garden](/notes/) to enter.

I'm a civil engineering student at Johns Hopkins, and I can never decide whether I have one too few or one too many hobbies. Find me elsewhere (or talk to me!) through the social links below.
