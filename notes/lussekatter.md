# lussekatter for the californian

Whether you're in for *lussekatter*, *lussebullar*, or plain old saffron buns, this gluten-free rendition of the Swedish classic is simple and hits the spot.

How easy? First-try easy, in my experience. How good? Make some and find out!

This is my American kitchen adaptation of a great [gluten-free recipe](https://www.arla.se/recept/glutenfria-lussekatter/) from the Arla Foods dairy company. Itâ€™ll probably work out for normal, gluten-laden flour without xanthan gum, but traditional recipes should cover that better, anyway!

## ingredients

### wets

- 5 1/4 tbsp butter

- 5/6 cup (1/2 + 1/3 cup) 2% milk

- 1 packet (7g) active dry yeast

- 1 egg

- about 0.4 cups *unsweetened* Greek yogurt
  
  - This is our replacement for the original recipe's [*kvarg*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_(dairy_product)).

- about 1/4 tsp powdered saffron
  
  - Adjust to taste!

- pinch of cardamom

### dries

- 350g gluten-free flour
  
  - I've had success with the Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose blend of rice flour & tapioca flour.
  
  - You might need more! Gluten-free flours vary, a lot.
  
  - I listed this in mass units instead of volume units because I don't like measuring out flour. Bags of gluten-free flour are usually small and mass-labeled, so we can just divide the bag's contents visually instead of measuring. If your bag says 624g, just pour out slightly over half to get 350g.

- 1/2 cup almond flour

- 1 tbsp xanthan gum
  
  - Omit this if you're using 1:1 flour, or flour that already has xanthan gum.
  
  - The original recipe uses psyllium husk, but xanthan gum works just fine.

- 1/2 cup superfine/castor sugar
  
  - Makes slightly sweet buns; adjust to taste.

- 1/4 tsp salt

### garnish

- 36 raisins

- egg yolk to glaze (optional)

## procedure

1. Gently warm the butter just until it melts completely. We don't want it very hot; just liquid.

2. Add the milk and yeast to the butter.
   
   - You can let the mixture sit for 10 min after this for the yeast to bloom, but this [doesn't seem necessary](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2015/09/25/active-dry-yeast) unless you suspect the yeast has died.

3. In a small bowl or cup, dissolve the saffron and cardamom in about a teaspoon of hot water. Add this to the milk mixture.

4. Set aside about 1/3 cup of the gluten-free flour for when you work the dough.

5. In a new bowl, thoroughly mix all of the remaining dry ingredients.

6. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and combine into a dough.
   
   - The dough won't necessarily be smooth at this point!
   
   - If the dough seems too sticky, add more flour.

7. Cover the dough and let it rise for 30 min.

8. Dust a work surface with the flour you set aside and turn the dough out onto it.
   
   - If the dough is *still* too sticky, you can work a little bit more flour in here. But be kind to your just-risen dough!

9. Portion the dough into 18 pieces.

10. Roll each piece into a snake (think Play-Doh), roll each side inward to create a spiralled *S*, and add a raisin to the center of each spiral. Place each on baking paper atop a sheet pan.

11. Let the buns rise for 30 minutes.

12. Set the oven to 450Â°F (or 440Â° if you can).

13. If you'd like the buns glazed, whisk up the egg yolk and apply with a pastry brush.

14. Bake the buns on the middle rack for 5-7 min.

Enjoy!
