# lussekatter for the californian

Whether you're in for *lussekatter*, *lussebullar*, or plain old saffron buns, this [[ncgs|gluten-free]] rendition of the Swedish classic is simple and hits the spot.

How easy? First-try easy, in my experience. How good? Make some and find out!

![some of my results (slightly overbaked, oops!)](/assets/recipes/lussekatter-baked.jpg)

This is my American kitchen adaptation of a great [gluten-free recipe](https://www.arla.se/recept/glutenfria-lussekatter/) from the Arla Foods dairy company. Itâ€™ll probably work out for normal, gluten-laden flour without xanthan gum, but traditional recipes should cover that better, anyway!

Makes twelve medium buns.

## materials

- 5 1/4 tbsp butter

- 5/6 cup (1/2 + 1/3 cup) 2% milk

- 1 packet (7g) active dry yeast

- 1 egg

- about 0.4 cups *unsweetened* Greek yogurt
  
  - This is our replacement for the original recipe's [*kvarg*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_(dairy_product)). You can use quark if you happen to have it, [labne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strained_yogurt#West_Asia_&_East_Mediterranean) if you're in a Middle-Eastern household, or basically any other savory [strained yogurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strained_yogurt).

- about 1/4 tsp powdered saffron
  
  - Adjust to taste!

- pinch of cardamom (careful, it's overpowering)

- about 600g gluten-free flour
  
  - I've had success with the Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose blend of rice flour & tapioca flour.
  
  - You might need more, you might need less. Gluten-free flours varyâ€”a lot.
  
  - I listed this in mass units instead of volume units because I'm bad at measuring. Bags of gluten-free flour are usually small and mass-labeled, so we can just use a fraction of the bag instead (or most of the bag, for the flour I listed).

- 1/2 cup almond flour

- 1 tbsp xanthan gum
  
  - Omit this if you're using 1:1 flour, or flour that already has xanthan gum.
  
  - The original recipe uses psyllium husk, but xanthan gum works just fine.

- 1/2 cup superfine/castor sugar
  
  - Makes slightly sweet buns; adjust to taste.

- 1/4 tsp salt

### garnish (optional)

- 36 raisins

- 1 egg to glaze

### other things

- baking paper

## procedure

![squishy dough!](/assets/recipes/lussekatter-unbaked.jpg)

1. In a medium bowl, gently warm the butter and milk together until the butter is completely melted.
   
   - We want everything hot but not scalding; cooked milk doesn't taste too good. In a microwave-safe bowl, you can heat everything with a microwave in  15-second increments.

2. Add the yeast to the milk mixture.
   
   - You can let the mixture sit for 10 minutes after this for the yeast to bloom, but this [doesn't seem necessary](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2015/09/25/active-dry-yeast) unless you suspect the yeast has died.

3. In a small bowl or cup, dissolve the saffron and cardamom in about a tablespoon of hot water. Add this to the milk mixture.

4. Whisk the 1 egg and the yogurt into the milk mixture.
   
   - Just get rid of big lumps; smaller ones are fine.

5. Set aside about a tablespoon of the gluten-free flour for when you work the dough.

6. Add the gluten-free flour, almond flour, xanthan gum, sugar, and salt. Combine into a dough.

7. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and set it somewhere warm. Let the dough rise for 30 minutes.
   
   - If your dough seemed dense or didn't turn out very smooth, it might not rise much. The buns will probably still be fine.

8. Lightly dust a work surface with a little bit of the flour you set aside. Turn the dough out onto the surface.

9. Portion the dough into 12 pieces.
   
   - I like making halves, then thirds of those, and then halves of those.

10. Roll each piece into a snake (think Play-Doh). Create a spiralled *S* by curling each tip of the snake inward. Add a raisin to the center of each spiral if you'd like. Place them on baking paper atop a sheet pan.

11. Cover the buns with a cloth and let them rise for 30 minutes.

12. Set the oven to 450Â°F (or 440Â° if you can).

13. If you'd like the buns glazed, whisk up your second egg with about a teaspoon of water. Apply it generously to the tops of the buns with a pastry brush or paper towel.

14. Bake the buns on the middle rack for 5-7 min.

Enjoy!

## notes & conclusion

I don't know how much flour this recipe really needs.  Arla's recipe calls for about half the amount I do, but that's always been too little in my experience. Uncertainty aside, our goal is just something doughy and moist, not pasty and sticky.

I'm no master baker; I'm always convinced I've made some fatal flaw, and that this recipe isn't going to work. Until it doesâ€”every time. It's remarkably forgiving, and that's why I recommend it.
