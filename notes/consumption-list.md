# media to consume

This is some of the media I’ve most enjoyed, am currently consuming, would recommend, or want to know better in the future. I've sprinkled in some of my favorite quotes, as well. I've kept most of these recommendations informative, wholesome, or "essential" in my mind (for now).

## books

* The Dispossessed (Ursula K. Le Guin)
* Giovanni’s Room (James Baldwin)
* How to Lie With Maps (Mark Monmonier)
  * "Not only is it easy to lie with maps, it's essential"
* Le Petit Prince (Antoine de Saint-Exupéry)
* The Boy, the Mole, the Fox, and the Horse (Charlie Mackesy)
* The Song of Achilles (Madeline Miller)
  * Promptly wept upon finishing.

## graphic novels

* Tillie Walden’s works:

  * also, its original French version: Jolies Ténèbres
* Out of The Blue (Ari; ongoing)
  * [tapas](https://tapas.io/series/OutoftheBlue) has the newest episodes, but the first few episodes on tapas have a different art style from the rest of the comic. Those first few pages have been redrawn and posted to [WEBTOON](https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/out-of-the-blue/list?title_no=192270&page=1).
