# cognates in disguise

One of my favorite, nerdiest pastimes is comparing related words, or [cognates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate), across languages. Sometimes, though, cognates aren't so easy to recognize.

For further reading on any of these, [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/) is a great resource!

## w, v, and... g?

Most languages spoken in Europe and India today developed from a continuum of dialects of *Proto-Indo-European*. Since differences from dialect to dialect were gradual, we can call that huge variety across the region a single predecessor "language." As local expression became more complex and specific, the rich langauge diversity we know today eventually came about. But Proto-Indo-European's roots prevail in all of its descendants.

Across English, French, and Swedish, I come across triplets of words that divide up into a consistent sound trichotomy. Words that start with a *w* in English often start with a *v* in Swedish (and other [Germanic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages#Modern_status)) and a hard *g* in French. The *w*-*v* relationship isn't so far-fetched; the *g* is the odd one out here.

While older forms of Vulgar Latin might have had *w*, now-France (*Gaul*) eventually lost that airy sound and replaced it with harsher sounds. Vikings—Germanic tribes called the [Franks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franks)—revived *w* in France when they arrived in the North. Through contact with the Franks, Northern *Norman* dialects re-adopted this sound as-is. Central France, though, instead adapted Frankish *w* words to fit local speech. There, they used *g* (or *gu*) to strengthen the *w* sound.[^1] Modern French derives from these old central French standards. Meanwhile, English picked up its typical *w* words from Norman French when they didn't come from old Germanic directly.

This creates parallels like:

| english                   | swedish                         | french                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| waffle                    | våffel                          | gaufre                                          |
| wait                      | vänta                           | guetter                                         |
| war                       | värre (worse)                   | guerre                                          |
| William                   | Vilhelm (slightly outdated)     | Guillaume                                       |
| ware (as in *warehouse*)  | vara (like in English)          | gare (train station; a little like *warehouse*) |
| ward                      | vård (protection)               | garder (keep)                                   |
| warn                      | varna                           | garnir (garnish, equip)                         |
| walk (originally to roll) | valka (to process & roll cloth) | gauche (left; this one is [weird][gauche])      |

English later re-borrowed some words like *garder* and *garnir* from French to produce modern doublets like *ward* and *guard*, and *warn* and *garnish*. Many of the French borrowings like those above also made their ways into other romance languages; *gaufre* and *guerre* led to *gofre* and *guerra* in Spanish, among others.

Apart from the joy I find in knowing that *waffle* is such a ubiquitous word, this also has a use for learners like me. When I don't know a word in Swedish that starts with *v* or a word in French that starts with hard *g*, I can start by replacing the beginning with *w* and asking myself which English word sounds similar.

## exhalation and *animal*

The Proto-Indo-Europeans described many things with [onomatopoeias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomatopoeia). Not all animals quack or moo, certainly—but all animals breathe. The sound for breathing eventually developed into a word for living, moving things.

Crudely, the major steps of the word's development are:

> hhhhh →&nbsp;hhhnms →&nbsp;anamos →&nbsp;animus →&nbsp;animal

I made a fun presentation on this word for some friends. I like to highlight how silly something like etymology can be.
