# cognates in disguise

One of my favorite, nerdiest pastimes is comparing related words, or [cognates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate), across languages. Sometimes, though, cognates aren't so easy to recognize.

## w, v, and... g?

Across English, French, and Swedish, I find triplets of words that divide up into a consistent sound trichotomy. Words that start with *w* in English often start with *g* in French and *v* in Swedish (and other [Germanic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages#Modern_status)). The *w*-*v* relationship isn't so far-fetched; the *g* is the odd one out here.

Germanic tribes called the [Franks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franks) brought *w* to now-France when the region still spoke a form of Vulgar Latin. But northern *Norman* dialects adopted this sound as-is. The replacement with *g* (or, normally, *gu*) developed in old central French dialects from a strengthening of the *w* sound to fit in better with local Latin sounds. Modern French derives from these old central French standards. Meanwhile, English picked up its typical *w* words from Norman French when they didn't come from old Germanic directly.

This lends parallels like:

| english                  | swedish                     | french                                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| waffle                   | v책ffel                      | gaufre                                          |
| wait                     | v채nta                       | guetter                                         |
| war                      | v채rre (worse)               | guerre                                          |
| William                  | Vilhelm (slightly outdated) | Guillaume                                       |
| ware (as in *warehouse*) | vara (like in English)      | gare (train station; a little like *warehouse*) |
| ward                     | v책rd (protection)           | garder (keep)                                   |

English re-borrowed some words like *garder* from French to produce modern doublets like *ward* and *guard*.
