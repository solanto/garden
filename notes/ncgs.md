## preface

This is a research summary about non-celiac gluten sensitivity (also known as *wheat sensitivity* or *gluten sensitivity*), its causes, and the accuracy of its name.

I wrote this in my senior year of high school, in 2019. I wasn't and am still not a medical expert, but I have been diagnosed with NCGS myself (as well as lactose intolerance, which is mentioned later). Some of my claims may be a little haughty, and my writing was definitely fluffier then. It's a bit of a text wall. I'm also unsure whether the statistical relationships I drew are really valid. Regardless, I learned more writing this essay than any other to date. 

Hey, at least we've got [formal citations](https://library.austincc.edu/help/cse/cse-cs.php).

# is gluten the culprit?

Gluten-free diets are in. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), though, as it gains increasing weight in a more gluten-aware consumer culture, remains a controversial diagnosis targeting gluten in light of its more historically-recognized competitors such as wheat allergies and celiac disease. Although its existence remains subject to intense debate within the scientific world and continues to be commonly cited by consumers, both widespread trends and recent findings suggest that non-celiac gluten sensitivity, in its true form, may be more uncommon than reported if not nonexistent altogether.

With recent shifts toward a broadened acceptance of gluten-free diets, the attribution of improved wellbeing to NCGS may experience a disproportionate increase. Skeptics of the prevalence of gluten-related disorders in general often emphasize the popular culture trend-like rise of gluten-free lifestyles. New York Times food culture correspondent Kim Severson explains, “[T]oday, if you aren’t gluten-free, you likely know someone who is or is trying to be. The style of eating has become a way of life for many and a national punch line for others”[^1]. While this attitude often neglects the painful, life-threatening realities of celiac disease and wheat allergies, it does bring to light an important observation: the number of gluten-free consumers is unusually high for its relation to diseases thought to be uncommon. The results of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2009-2014 indicate that, in a span of five years, the number of Americans without celiac disease avoiding gluten has more than tripled, with an original 0.52% of individuals climbing to 1.69%[^2]. Yet, the percentage of those diagnosed with celiac disease (being the primary noncontroversial gluten-related diagnosis) has remained relatively constant[^2]. This roughly 3:1 discrepancy between gluten-related diagnosis and lifestyle change suggests that an unnecessarily large proportion of Americans follows a gluten-free diet. In light of the method of diagnosis of NCGS, this poses a medically disadvantageous issue. Elli et al. at the Center for the Prevention and Diagnosis of Celiac Disease in Milan, Italy, note that “[t]o date, NCGS is mainly a ‘diagnosis of exclusion’ made after other wheat-related and non-wheat-related disorders have been ruled out”[^3]. With no reliable test or marker[^4]<sup>,</sup>[^5] , NCGS becomes an overtly common explanation for patients’ observed improvement in health after switching to a gluten-free diet, despite its lack of concrete definition and origins. Mansueto et al., a group of medical researchers originating in the internal medicine departments of the University of Palermo, Guzzardi Hospital, and Giovanni Paolo II Hospital, Italy, confirm, “The NCGS diagnosis is often suggested by the patients themselves, who report GI and extra-intestinal symptoms after wheat/gluten ingestion and become asymptomatic on GFD. However, the lack of diagnostic biomarkers for NCGS is an unsolved problem; consequently, the real frequency of NCGS itself is controversial”[^4]. In this way, the apparent prevalence of NCGS experiences significant inflation as patients continually report it with little reason in support, while medical professionals have likewise little reason to deny such claims. This inflation conceals the true rarity of formally-diagnosed NCGS cases.

Aside from its likely uncommonality in its presently-diagnosed form, NCGS may be a misdiagnosis altogether. Mansueto et al. conclude that “NCGS has an immune-mediated pathogenesis and [...] could be considered, for some percentage of the cases, a non IgE-mediated, allergic-like condition”[^4], but this view is optimistic at best in its consideration of NCGS. Though the group’s cited information, as aforementioned, does agree with a majority of sources, its findings overstate the significance of NCGS itself, if any. Järbrink-Sehgal and Talley, American Board of Medicine-certified physician and Editor-in-Chief of the Medical Journal of Australia, respectively, state that “NCGS is unlikely to be a single or distinct disease. In many cases, NCGS is likely a mislabeled functional GI disorder (IBS or FD) induced by wheat proteins or FODMAPS [fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols; sugars that ferment in the gastrointestinal tract]”[^6]. Mansueto et al.’s conclusion that “[their] experience suggests that one third of IBS patients [all of whose symptoms overlap with those of NCGS] could benefit from a wheat-free diet”[^4] completely lacks Järbrink-Sehgal and Talley’s weighted consideration of external factors such as allergic reactions and FODMAPs. The latter of these factors, in fact, has been shown to be the likely cause of NCGS symptoms. Intolerance of lactose and fructose, two of the most common of the FODMAPs[^7], overlap in one third of studied cases[^8]. With fructose’s high prevalence in wheat-based food in the form of fructans (polymer chains of fructose)[^9], this suggests a broad link between wheat-related sensitivities and other FODMAP sensitivities such as lactose intolerance. While from this data only correlation can be concluded, a recent study has shown fructans to be a definitive cause of NCGS symptoms. Carried out by Skodje et al. across the Jebsen Celiac Disease Research Centre and the Department of Nutrition of the University of Oslo, Norway, the study concludes that “fructans are more likely to induce symptoms in those reporting sensitivity to wheat, rye, and barley [...] weaken[ing] the use of the term ‘NCGS’ and rais[ing] doubts about the need for a gluten-free diet in such patients” through a double-blind crossover challenge (in which subjects are randomly exposed to various effectors over time)[^10]<sup>,</sup>[^11]. With its difficulty to sufficiently back in diagnosis and concretely proven insignificance, NCGS is more than likely an entirely inaccurate label for patients’ symptoms.

Despite NCGS’ apparent rise in popularity among self-diagnoses and gluten-free lifestyles and the continued scientific discussion this has raised, the prospects of the diagnosis are poor considering recent findings concerning its pathology and statistical inconsistencies surrounding its growth. Whether gluten can be fully discredited or high-FODMAP diets are further investigated in contribution to NCGS research, it remains clear that, especially compared to that of fructans, gluten itself is of little proven significance to NCGS’ purported suite of gastrointestinal symptoms.
